## Description
ant is a PyTorch-based Deep Learning framework. It was inspired by [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), even though it does not borrow code from it. It strives to be even cleaner, faster and have more features. Specifically, ant's core is about half the size of nanoGPT, ant is around 20% faster (end-to-end) and has significantly more (and more modern) features. To name a few, ant also supports BERT, RoPE and ALiBi, ResNet, [Maximal Update Parametrization (ÂµP)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/%C2%B5transfer-a-technique-for-hyperparameter-tuning-of-enormous-neural-networks/) and [FineWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb).
